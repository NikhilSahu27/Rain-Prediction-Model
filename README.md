# Rain-Prediction-Model

Developed and implemented a rain prediction model in Python using machine learning algorithms, with a focus on Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM.

Conducted thorough data analysis and preprocessing leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations.

Utilized scikit-learn extensively for algorithm implementation, model evaluation, and optimization, achieving a notable accuracy of 82.74% with Logistic Regression.
